# &lt;AI &amp; Equality> A Human Rights Toolbox

Supporting code for the workshop that was conducted during the [Master thesis](https://github.com/s-kypr/aiequality/blob/main/AI-Equality_A_Human_Rights_Toolbox_Sofia_Kypraiou__Master_thesis_.pdf) at EPFL (*March - August 2021*).

Author: Sofia KYPRAIOU \
Supervisors: Prof. Daniel GATICA-PEREZ (Idiap, EPFL), Caitlin KRAFT-BUCHMAN (Women at the Table)



## Usage

An Google colab version of the code is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11SWijBDkr1pSgIXyjUkgoSB0gh5oAlaI?usp=sharing).

## Research Objectives

The aim of this study is to investigate:\
 **RQ:** How can International Human Rights frameworks be integrated with current concepts of
fairness for the design of an educational tool for computer scientists?

**Research Objective 1:** Study current approaches on ethics and fairness in machine learning
and examine their main limitations

**Research Objective 2:** Propose, design, and build an educational tool for computer scientists
- Propose how to combine different practical fairness tools in a single Jupyter notebook
- Examine how to incorporate a human rights-based apporach in the fariness pipeline
  a Pre-processing (data)
  b In-processing (model)
  c Post-processing (evaluation)
 
 ## Approach
 
 The Toolbox is based on an idea of the NGO Women at the Table (W@tt), and its
collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR) and its Womenâ€™s Human Rights and Gender Section. Piloted at EPFL through workshops,
<AI & Equality> A Human Rights Toolbox addresses the problem head-on in language
computer science students can both understand and use. It proves a basic human rights
workshop blended with tools to directly and immediately see how human rights principles can
be applied and thought about analytically in code. 

We explored the concepts with an in-depth Jupyter notebook that takes
the Human Rights module and marries it in discussion to concrete examples and exercises
that reveal how human rights principles are at interplay with the code. The Jupyter notebook
investigates how code can be de-biased and improved to support Human Rights principles of
non-discrimination and equality, participation, and accountability.
